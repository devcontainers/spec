# Proposals

The files in this folder detail active proposals to the Dev Container Specification.

We add any proposal to the [**proposals folder**](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/tree/main/proposals), only if the proposal is accepted. It stays in that folder until the implementation is in progress. Once code/schema changes are released, we move it into the [**specs folder**](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/tree/main/docs/specs).

> **Note:** Our [contributing.md](/contributing.md) documents guidelines on contributing to the spec, as well as labels (proposal and finalization) defined for this process for GitHub issues.
