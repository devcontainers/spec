# Specification Documentation

The files in this folder detail the Dev Container Specification.

We add any proposal to the [**proposals folder**](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/tree/main/proposals), only if the proposal is accepted. It stays in that folder until the implementation is in progress. Once code/schema changes are released, we move it into the [**specs folder**](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/tree/main/docs/specs).

> **Note:** Our [contributing.md](/contributing.md) documents guidelines on contributing to the spec, as well as labels (proposal and finalization) defined for this process for GitHub issues.

There are several main specs in this folder, outlining the key top-level behavior of dev containers, Templates, and Features:

* [Main dev container spec](/docs/specs/devcontainer-reference.md)
* [Dev container metadata reference](/docs/specs/devcontainerjson-reference.md)
* [Main Templates spec](/docs/specs/devcontainer-templates.md)
* [Templates distribution spec](/docs/specs/devcontainer-templates-distribution.md)
* [Main Features spec](/docs/specs/devcontainer-features.md)
* [Features distribution spec](/docs/specs/devcontainer-features-distribution.md)
* [Tools that support the spec](/docs/specs/supporting-tools.md)

The remainder of the files in this folder outline specifications for specific dev container behaviors. Each file includes links to when the proposal was first discussed and when it was merged into the Dev Container CLI or schema.
