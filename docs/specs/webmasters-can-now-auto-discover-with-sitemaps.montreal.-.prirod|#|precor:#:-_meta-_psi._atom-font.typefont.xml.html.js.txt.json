						<h2>Webmasters Can Now Auto-Discover With Sitemaps</h2>

						<div class="entry-body">
							<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000380.html">working with Google and Microsoft</a> to support a single format for submission with Sitemaps, we have continued to discuss further enhancements to make it easy for webmasters to get their content to all search engines quickly.</p>
<p>All search crawlers recognize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a>, so it seemed like a good idea to use that mechanism to allow webmasters to share their Sitemaps. You agreed and encouraged us to allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?prop=SiteExplorer&amp;fid=2854">robots.txt discovery of Sitemaps</a> on our suggestion board. We took the idea to Google and Microsoft and are happy to announce today that you can now find your sitemaps in a uniform way across all participating engines. To do this, simply add the following line to your robots.txt file:</p>
<p>Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml</p>
<p>Please provide the complete URL for your Sitemap on this line. We will pick it up wherever you put it in your robots.txt file. This directive is not specific to user-agent. If you have multiple Sitemaps, you can point to your Sitemap index file on this line. Details about the Sitemaps protocol including this addition are available on the protocol website &#8212; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://www.sitemaps.org/">http://www.sitemaps.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can continue to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit">issue Sitemaps to Yahoo! Search</a> by simply inputting the URL for your Sitemap and submitting. Or add feeds to a site you are already managing under &#8216;My Sites&#8217; in Site Explorer. This also allows us to provide more feedback to you about what we are doing with the sitemap.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also happy to have some east coasters, Ask and IBM, announce their support for Sitemaps. The more the merrier!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also be sharing more this week at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://www.searchenginestrategies.com/sew/ny07/">SES NY</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other thoughts about how we can collaborate with other search engines on standards such as robots.txt, we&#8217;d love to hear from you &#8212; visit our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=SiteExplorer">suggestion board</a>.</p>

								<p>Excellent idea to point the sitemap in robots.txt. I considered to submit my sitemap via an HTTP request but couldn&#8217;t found (according with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://www.sitemaps.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitemaps.org</a>) what is &#8220;searchengine_URL&#8221; in &#8220;searchengine_URL/ping?sitemap=sitemap_url&#8221;.</p>

								<p>Good to see more use being made of Robots.txt. How about incorporating other useful hints for search engines such as a geographic location to ensure sites are listed in the correct country search. (This could not be abused as there&#8217;s only one robots.txt file per site and only one location would be accepted.)</p>
<p>(Also to GlobalOneTechnology, Google&#8217;s Matt Cutts has blogged on the Webmaster Tools error, it will be fixed.)</p>

								<p>It&#8217;s good to see uniform recognition for this amongst search engines. If sitemap.xml becomes a regognised standard could search engines simply look for it in the same way they do the robots.txt file?</p>

								<p>Just wondering if what is the reason to force webmasters to provide FULL paths (starting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://ysearchblog.com/2007/04/11/webmasters-can-now-auto-discover-with-sitemaps/" rel="nofollow">http://</a> ) to sitemap files?! Why the &#8220;Sitemap:&#8221; entry format should NOT comply with &#8220;Disallow:&#8221; entry format that requires RELATIVE paths, and why there is no way to specify multiple sitemaps in one row like multiple paths to ignore separated by space in the same row?</p>

								<p>Looks like it will still take some time for the robots.text file validators to update, if in fact they do. None of them recognize this new syntax yet.</p>
<p>Just because the big Search Engines now allow this declaration does not in itself mean that it has been added to the robots.txt standard.</p>

								<p>RE: Comment #9: &#8220;How about incorporating other useful hints for search engines such as a geographic location to ensure sites are listed in the correct country search?&#8221;</p>
<p>We already have that:</p>
<p>- DNS LOC RR (RFC 1876).<br/>
- HTML META NAME=&#8221;Geo.Position&#8221; (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://geourl.org/)." rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090305061841/http://geourl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://geourl.org/</a>).</p>

								<p>Re: Sitemap requiring a completely specified URL</p>
<p>Note that although Yahoo says it must be a complete URL, the definition at sitemaps.org says only that it &#8220;SHOULD&#8221; be a complete URL, which implies (at least to me) that relative URLs are permitted.  If it were a requirement, then the language would have said &#8220;MUST.&#8221;  It seems that Google allows and properly handles relative URLs for sitemaps.  If Yahoo is saying that they expect only a complete URL, then I say that they are not following the standard agreed upon with the other search engine operators.</p>

								<p>Hi,<br/>
I have a 7 year old site that has been in yahoo&#8217;s directory since 2000/2001 - for some reason yahoo has always just showed 1 url for this domain meanwhile over the years the site has always had around 100 or more pages</p>
<p>I have added the site to yahoo explorer but still it only ever shows 1 listing</p>
<p>My stats shows that the yahoo robot visits the site regular but still only 1 listing</p>
<p>Yahoo currently shows over 6000 backlinks but still just the index page is listed</p>
<p>Ive been racking my brain trying to figure out what is wrong but with no luck</p>
<p>Please can anyone make any suggestions to me as to what to do?</p>
<p>Regards<br/>
Reggie</p>
