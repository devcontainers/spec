## Goal

Extend the build section of the configuration with an option to pass additional arguments via cli.

## Proposal

Introduce the property `options` to the `build` property in the schema as type `Array (string)`. This field contains elements that are directly passed as cli-arguments to the `build` command. It is similar to `runArgs` property which contains cli-arguments passed to the `run` command.

###  Execution

When a dev container is built, all entries from the `options` are passed to the `build` command after all other options.

## Examples

### Add a host

The following example adds a host-definition while the image is being built:

```jsonc
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "options": [
      "--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ]
  },
}
```

### Use host network

The following example allows to use the host network while building an image:

```jsonc
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "options": [
      "--network=host"
    ]
  },
}
```
